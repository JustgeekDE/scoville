# Scoville - where SPICE and unit testing meet 
Scoville is an experimental unit testing framework for SPICE simulations, written in python and built as an extension to the existing python testing frameworks. 

The aim is to be able to sketch out circuits and have them automatically tested against a SPICE simulation during development. Once actual hardware has been built, the same tests could be run against the hardware as well.

A small example project can be found [here](https://github.com/JustgeekDE/exampleHardwareRepo).
